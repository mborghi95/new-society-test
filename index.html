            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>So there I was on January 6th, 2020, thinking I was going to a peaceful protest at the Capitol. Next thing I know, I'm climbing walls like Spider-Man, wearing my favorite buffalo horn hat (which I borrowed from a very fashion-forward friend), and accidentally ending up in Nancy Pelosi's office trying to figure out how to work her printer because I really needed to print my tax returns. The whole thing was a misunderstanding - I was actually just looking for the Capitol's gift shop to buy a snow globe for my mom. You should have seen the look on the FBI agent's face when I tried to explain that I was just there for the souvenir shop's January clearance sale!</p>
            
            <h2>My Mission</h2>
            <p>My ultimate mission is to establish the most epic doomsday-ready homestead that New Hampshire has ever seen. While all my neighbors are worried about their lawn ornaments, I'm building a chicken army (free-range soldiers, of course) and a woodshop that could survive nuclear winter. We're talking a bunker disguised as a chicken coop, filled with enough canned beans and ammo to last until the aliens arrive. The woodshop isn't just for making cute little birdhouses - it's my front for crafting tactical garden gnomes and stealth picket fences. And don't even get me started on my underground hydroponics system that I totally didn't learn about from watching prison escape documentaries. When the grid goes down and the zombies come, you'll all want to be friends with the guy who has 47 varieties of heirloom tomatoes and a crossbow-wielding rooster named Colonel Sanders.</p>
