            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>So there I was on January 6th, 2020, thinking I was going to a peaceful protest at the Capitol. Next thing I know, I'm climbing walls like Spider-Man, wearing my favorite buffalo horn hat (which I borrowed from a very fashion-forward friend), and accidentally ending up in Nancy Pelosi's office trying to figure out how to work her printer because I really needed to print my tax returns. The whole thing was a misunderstanding - I was actually just looking for the Capitol's gift shop to buy a snow globe for my mom. You should have seen the look on the FBI agent's face when I tried to explain that I was just there for the souvenir shop's January clearance sale!</p>
            
            <h2>My Mission</h2>
            <p>My dream is to establish a self-sustainable homestead in the beautiful state of New Hampshire. I envision a peaceful property where I can raise chickens, build a fully equipped woodshop, and create beautiful handcrafted pieces. This homestead will be my sanctuary where I can combine traditional craftsmanship with modern technology, all while living closer to nature.</p>
